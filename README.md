Excellent Store Challenge

Introduction

Impact Stores, popularly known as “The Excellent Store”, is a leading indigenous chain of stores with headquarters in Gbagi, Oyo, Nigeria. At the core of their business is a strong sense of excellence and entrepreneurial value. And this is evident in all their 1,500 products, available to all segments of the population at customer-friendly prices, across 10 stores in different cities of Nigeria.


Problem Statement

The CEO of the company plans to expand the chain of stores to more Nigerian cities in 2025. However, as the COVID19 restrictions have affected the retail business, he sees the need to better understand which products return higher profits at specific stores so as to inform the expansion plan.


Project Aim

As the new Retail Data Analyst, I was engaged to build a predictive model and find out the profit returns on each product at a particular store. The scenario he sees is where a brand of juice sold for N250 in one of his store branches may also be sold at N230 at another store within Chief Babatunji's chain of stores. He needs to therefore understand what type of product, market clusters and store type (location, age, size) will give more profit returns as he plans to expand to more cities in the country.


Project Methodology

As a the new Data Scientist, I will be offering a promising alternative through the building of a predictive model. In this project, we will be exploring excellent store data by utilizing this approach:
-	Data Collection and Preprocessing - Gather relevant data and preprocess it to ensure it is clean and ready for analysis.
-	Exploratory data Analysis- Conduct analysis to understand the characteristics of the data and identify patterns or trends.
-	Feature Engineering - Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the performance of the machine learning models.
-	Building the Model - Utilize machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression for binary outcome prediction, Decision Trees for node splitting, Random Forest for ensemble learning, and XGBoost for fast and efficient processing to build the Store prediction model.


-	Deployment and Monitoring: Deploy the model in a production environment and establish a monitoring system to track its performance over time. Update the model as needed to adapt to changing circumstances.
